##### Learning Goals

After completing this chapter, learners should be able to:

* Apply popular mapping workflows to create maps with spatial data
* Assess which workflow works best in different situations
* Apply cartographic best practices to a map composition in R
:::

##### Workshop Description

In this workshop, participants will learn how to use several options for composing maps in R.

##### Prerequisites

For the best experience, we recommend learners have the following skills before taking this workshop:

* an introductory understanding of programming in R (for example, you are familiar with how to load libraries, load common data formats like a CSV, and are comfortable running basic commands). See DataLab's [R Basics Workshop](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_r_basics/) for help.
* an introductory understanding of spatial data (for example, you are familiar with the difference between raster and vector data). See [DataLab's Spatial Data Formats Workshop](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_spatial_data_formats/) for help.

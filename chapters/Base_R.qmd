# Base R

R comes with tools to create basic graphs like scatter plots. Many spatial data packages extend these tools to work with spatial data, allowing us to use the `plot()` function to visualize spatial data in map form.  This is often a quick and convenient way to visualize your data to check results.

```{r chunk-label, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
	1 + 1
	rnorm(10)  # 10 random numbers
	#plot(dist ~ speed, cars)  # a scatterplot
```

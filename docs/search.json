This is the same data we use in the Cartography for Academic Publications Workshop.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nFor the best experience, we recommend learners have the following skills before taking this workshop:\n\nan introductory understanding of programming in R (for example, you are familiar with how to load libraries, load common data formats like a CSV, and are comfortable running basic commands). See DataLab’s R Basics Workshop for help.\nan introductory understanding of spatial data (for example, you are familiar with the difference between raster and vector data). See DataLab’s Spatial Data Formats Workshop for help.\n(recommended) review the concepts (first section) of DataLab’s Cartography for Academic Publications Workshop",

Making good quality maps, however, takes a different set of skills.\nIf you haven’t already, download the workshop data from the online repository. If you downloaded a .zip file, unzip the data to a folder you can easily find.\nThe data we have to work with today is:\nGeopackage (.gpkg) is a single file, open vector format. We’re using it today because it’s one file per dataset (unlike Shapefile), which makes data management so much easier.

You want your readers to understand the relationship between the monster locations and also their location on the planet. In our imaginary scenario, we plan to submit our paper to one of the Nature journals.\nWhat’s the story? What should readers learn from this map?

    "text": "2.1 Intro to plot()\nR comes with tools to create basic graphs like scatter plots. Many spatial data packages extend these tools to work with spatial data, allowing us to use the plot() function to visualize spatial data in map form. This is often a quick and convenient way to visualize your data to check results.\nIt seems pretty intuitive, but let’s look at what happens if we use the plot command to plot our monsters data:\nplot(monsters)\nWhoops! What happened? If we don’t specify which column in the attribute table to plot, plot() tries to plot all of them sequentially. If you have a large dataset, this can take a while and it’s almost never what we actually want.\nLet’s just plot the shapes without any data. We can do this by specifying that we want to plot the geometry column. In this case, it’s called “geom”. We can also use the st_geometry() function to access the geometries.\nplot(st_geometry(monsters))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  #Both of these work, but require you to know the name of the geometry column:\n  #plot(monsters$geom)  \n  #plot(monsters[\"geom\"])\nWe can see the distribution of the data and if you use your imagination, you might be able to make out the general shapes of the continents.\nLet’s plot them by marker type:\nplot(monsters[\"marker\"])\nThat’s pretty rough, but it gives us an idea of how the marker (animal forms) are distributed in the dataset.",

So how can we show more than one layer on the same plot? plot() has an argument called add that is boolean (either TRUE or FALSE) and the default is set to FALSE. If we specify TRUE, we can add multiple layers to the same plot. It draws the plots in order, so whatever we want to be the lowest layer, we need to plot that first. Let’s try plotting the monsters (points) over the states layer (polygons):\n\n  plot(st_geometry(states)) \n  plot(st_geometry(monsters), add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk!

It doesn’t have a way to avoid label collisions (overlaps) and the placement options don’t really do much to avoid labels running over the symbols. I also haven’t found much guidance on placing the labels. Most of the tutorials avoid this problem by labeling polygons where the exact placement isn’t a concern. Like the discussion of plot(), this map would benefit from moving the labels by hand. Export a pdf and edit it in a vector illustration software like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.",

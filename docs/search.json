This is the same data we use in the Cartography for Academic Publications Workshop.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nFor the best experience, we recommend learners have the following skills before taking this workshop:\n\nan introductory understanding of programming in R (for example, you are familiar with how to load libraries, load common data formats like a CSV, and are comfortable running basic commands). See DataLab’s R Basics Workshop for help.\nan introductory understanding of spatial data (for example, you are familiar with the difference between raster and vector data). See DataLab’s Spatial Data Formats Workshop for help.\n(recommended) review the concepts (first section) of DataLab’s Cartography for Academic Publications Workshop",

Making good quality maps, however, takes a different set of skills.\nIf you haven’t already, download the workshop data from the online repository. If you downloaded a .zip file, unzip the data to a folder you can easily find.\nThe data we have to work with today is:\nGeopackage (.gpkg) is a single file, open vector format. We’re using it today because it’s one file per dataset (unlike Shapefile), which makes data management so much easier. See the README.txt file that comes with the data download for more details and sources of the data.",

This dataset was assembled from Wikipedia’s List of Lake Monsters. The lake names were geocoded (you can find the R script that I wrote to process the data in the r_scripts folder of this repo, corrected, then exported to a geopackage file. Why did I process this data for you? It took a few hours to do and requires skills we are not focusing on in this workshop.\n\n\n1.1.2 Recommended File Structure\nThis is the folder structure this workshop will assume you have:\nworkshop_maps_in_r/\n└── data/\n └── LakeMonsters.gpkg\n \n └── Lakes_GreatLakes-Area.gpkg  \n \n └── README.txt\n \n └── US_CAN_Admin1.gpkg  \n└── output/",

You want your readers to understand the relationship between the monster locations and also their location on the planet. In our imaginary scenario, we plan to submit our paper to one of the Nature journals.\nWhat’s the story? What should readers learn from this map? What data do you need to tell that story effectively?\nThe story I plan to tell is: where are these monsters reported to live in the US Great Lakes area? What are their names? For reference, what lakes and states or provinces are they in? The story you want to tell might be different, so feel free to make adjustments as needed.",

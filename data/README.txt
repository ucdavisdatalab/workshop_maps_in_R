*** Data ***

LakeMonsters.gpkg
This data started with the table on Wikipedia's List of Lake Monsters page (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lake_monsters). This data was geolocated, first with an R script to geocode the lake names using the tmapstools package, and then corrected by finding lake locations manually in OpenStreetMap.
